    "Swimming, as described by [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/sports/swimming-sport), is the propulsion of the body through water by combined arm and leg motions and the natural flotation of the body. The sport has been a part of the Olympic stage since the inaugural modern Olympic Games held in 1896.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze a century worth of Olympic swimming results and use that data to predict what time it will take to win a gold medal at the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympic Games in both the Men's and Women's 100m Freestyle events. For that we need to go over some of the basics of swimming to provide us with the tools to efficiently read the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swimming Fundamentals:\n",
    "- The competition is held in a 50 meter pool.\n",
    "- The 8 fastest swimmers from the preliminaries (and semi-finals in some disciplines) advance to the final.\n",
    "- At the conclusion of the finals, medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) are presented to the top 3 finishers.\n",
    "- Ties can occur (even though it is rare)."

    "The goal of this project is to find a model that fits the data and use it to predict if the above hypothesis can be accepted. Before digging into the results of the 100m freestyle over time let's explore the dataset and prepare it for our analysis."

Given the rapid development around sports over the past few decades and the continuous improvements in performance, it is safe to expect a linear relationship between the predictor and response (x- and y-axis). Once the data is visualized, it will be easier to confirm whether a linear regression model (univariate in this case) can be of any use for predicting the results of the 2024 Olympics or not.  "

    "It appears that these are likely the best-fit linear models for our analysis purpose. Looking at the scatterplots we can identify a few interesting patterns. First, the affect of the World Wars on the Olympic Games. In 1916, 1940, and 1944, the Olympic Games got canceled. There was a significant improvement in winning times between 1912 and 1920, while little to no improvements between 1936 and 1948. The Cold War Era, where (unfortunately) certain countries experimented on their athletes by launching state-sponsored, systematic doping programs lead to drastic improvements in winning times that explains why most entries between the 60s and the 2000s are below the line. More on doping [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_East_Germany). The establishment of WADA, World Anti-Doping Agency, in 1999 led to strict enforcement of doping regulations, which can explain why the improvement in winning times for the past few Olympics slowed down leading to the entries appearing above the line. Also, athletes are likely encountering the peak of human performance leading to a more flat linear pattern for the upcoming years."

However, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is relatively high for women, which can mean two things: the model is not a good fit, or there are outliers that skew the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "My considerations are as follows:\n",
    "1. The predicted times are significantly faster than the current world records, which makes this analysis irrealistic.\n",
    "2. Most, if not all, outliers are from eras when external factors deeply affected outcomes. (wars, mass doping scandals, etc.)\n",
    "3. Sports only got commercialized a few decades ago. It was a luxury in earlier eras. (significantly less participants)\n",
    "4. Linear regression is a good fit to predict swimming outcomes but the data is insufficient for our goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach would be:\n",
    "- Analyze world ranking data for every year (I could not find this in an ingestable format).\n",
    "- Select a cutoff date that is after the times when outliers occurred. (Post-War Era)\n",
    "- Account for all possible external factors.\n",
    "- Compare results with other sports.\n",
    "- Consider gender disparities in performance trends.\n",
